Absolutely,1
Dear Twitter Advertisers,1
Meeting a lot of cool people at Twitter today!,0
Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in!,0
Definitely closer to citizen journalism – local news orgs are under-appreciated &amp; should get way more prominence on Twitter,0
Nobody bats 1000 ,1
A beautiful thing about Twitter is how it empowers citizen journalism – people are able to disseminate news without an establishment bias,0
I’m a big fan of citizen journalism!,1
“According to unnamed sources close to the matter who wish to remain anonymous” ,0
"“The New York Times has emerged as a new, chaotic actor in global politics. The paper’s interventions in some of the world’s most combustible conflicts have sometimes been a boon, but their messaging has also caused problems.”",0
Yes!,0
30% is a lot,0
Concerning,0
Works on any moving land object,0
Fasting rocks,0
Had to do a double-take. This is the first non-fake Vitalik tweet I’ve seen in a while.,0
One man’s hedge is another man’s shrub,0
Yup,0
TRUE,0
Too much respect for authority inhibits innovation,1
What lesson took you the longest to unlearn?,0
διαλεκτική,0
"Twitter should be as broadly inclusive as possible, serving as a fair forum for lively, even if occasionally rancorous, debate between widely divergent beliefs.",0
Absolutely necessary,0
!,0
Important,0
Yup,1
Exactly!,0
"Yeah, doesn’t make sense",1
Good thread,1
I only play crazy 9’s,0
"That’s the plan, unless it is damaged in testing. What really matters is that ship &amp; booster production line is spooling up. Also, each new ship &amp; booster has incremental design improvements.",0
"Yeah, I’m back to spare bedroom /couch surfing at friend’s houses in Silicon Valley, which I did for about a decade.Frankly, I like it this way, as I get to see my friends, who I love, more often.",0
"I did as a child, but found it to be too simple to be useful in real life: a mere 8 by 8 grid, no fog of war, no technology tree, no random map or spawn position, only 2 players, both sides exact same pieces, etc.Polytopia addresses these limitations.",0
"And I don’t even own a house, let alone a “mansion”, you douche",1
"While it’s true that Kasparov is almost as good at playing chess as my iPhone, he is otherwise an idiot",0
Yes,0
How exciting to be alive at the same time as the largest animal ever! Wild that Blue whales are bigger than the biggest dinosaur.,0
You’re most welcome,0
"Before DoD even came back with an answer, I told  that SpaceX would not turn off Starlink even if DoD refused to provide funding",0
Absolutely!,0
Interesting,0
Great game,0
"Maybe it was a social media algorithm, not even people",0
Think about who might have decided “The Current Thing” before accepting it,0
Who decides “The Current Thing?”Real question. I don’t know.,1
Exactly. WaPo are such hypocrites.,0
Neuralink show &amp; tell now on Nov 30,1
Had to be done,0
We’ve come a long way,0
i know|nothing|is forever,0
Good point ,0
This needs to change. Manufacturing is awesome!,0
It will happen,0
Hear! Hear!,0
Why are you perpetuating propaganda concocted by the oil &amp; gas industry to distract you from the 6 trillion dollars per *year* of subsidies those companies receive?,0
"Switzerland &amp; Belgium have great chocolate, but I do also love eccentric British &amp; Irish artisanal sweet shops",0
Good thread,1
"Next week. It’s actually a major release, so a lot more internal testing is needed before going to public beta.",0
Cool,1
 Although there could be more R&amp;D in candy tbh. Feels like there hasn’t been much improvement in decades.,0
"Headline is misleading. Starlink can obviously offer far more robust positioning than GPS, as it will have ~1000X more satellites over time. Not all will have line of sight to users, but still &gt;10X GPS &amp; far stronger signal.Just not today’s problem.",0
One of my favorite conspiracy theories is that the world is actually 80% men,0
un ass ailable logic!,0
Yes,0
"You’re right. Eventually, we all run out of time.",0
"Only Giga Berlin can make these colors, as paint shop was specially built to apply many fine layers of paint, giving it complexity not otherwise possible",0
"Varies a lot. Tesla &amp; SpaceX are in good positions, but many other companies are not. Recessions do have a silver lining in that companies that shouldn’t exist stop existing.",0
"Those who want Putin removed are laboring under the misapprehension that whoever replaces him will be more amenable to peace or western philosophy, but I think this is unlikely – the Kremlin is not the Nice Guy Olympics",0
"Russia overrunning Ukraine would destabilize the entire region, perhaps the world",1
"If Russia faced calamitous defeat in conventional warfare for something as strategically critical as Crimea, the probability of using nuclear weapons is high",0
I do. Yes.,0
"Still very unlikely, but this is the closest we’ve been since Cuba in ‘62",1
"Just guessing, but probably until spring of ‘24",0
It sure would be nice to have one year without a horrible global event,0
“Brutal for both sides” will be a common phrase in the months to come,0
No way,0
Maybe,0
Certainly warrants closer scrutiny,0
"Btw, how’s it going in Bakhmut?",0
Pretty good troll tbh,0
*humour,0
I couldn’t agree more ,1
British humor is the best,0
Compromise is overwhelmingly the most likely outcome – just a question of how much death &amp; destruction happens before then,0
That should be the nature of the debate,1
"Most probable outcome by far is a horrible war of attrition that destroys Ukraine &amp; severely damages Russia, with massive body count on both sides.And, in the end, the same outcome. So why?",1
Exactly,0
Congrats to  team on 48th launch this year! Falcon 9 now holds record for most launches of a single vehicle type in a year.,0
Same,0
Exactly,0
"SpaceX has more active satellites in orbit than rest of Earth combined, tracking to double rest of Earth soon",0
"The media reports with great fanfare my predictions that are late, but rarely those that come early",0
Accelerating sustainable energy is our primary mission,0
"Will require truly exceptional execution, but it is possible",0
"I will not let you down, no matter what it takes",0
Awesome,0
"We even did a Starlink video call on one airplane aloft to Starlink on another, far away, airplane aloft and it worked perfectly with no lag!",0
Vox Populi Vox Dei,0
"Several major architectural upgrades in 10.69.3, so it’s much more than a point release, but we’re sticking with 10.69 just cause haha",1
Sounds fair,0
Definitely giving me kid naming ideas ,0
And … sold out!,0
Internet in airplanes will feel same as if you were accessing Internet at home!,1
"28,700 bottles of exquisite Burnt Hair perfume already sold! Only 1,300 left of this unique, limited edition, collector’s item.",0
We’re working on it. Hope to release something next week.,0
"No money from DoD, but several other countries, orgs &amp; individuals are paying for ~11k/25k terminals (thanks!).SpaceX is losing ~$20M/month due to unpaid service &amp; costs related to enhanced security measures for cyberwar defense, but we’ll keep doing it (sigh).",0
Smart? Maybe. Does dumb stuff? Definitely!,0
TRUE,0
Exactly,1
"Should I make weapons? Ideally, not.",0
An easy prediction,0
Drone War I,1
(Actually) Smart Summon is almost done,0
Yes,0
I have a plan,1
Thanks Optimus :),1
"To be precise, 25,300 terminals were sent to Ukraine, but, at present, only 10,630 are paying for service",1
SpaceX has already withdrawn its request for funding,1
"Wrong analogy. America also had a humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan. No one in America sees that country as part of America.Crimea *is* seen as a crucial part of Russia by Russia, much as Hawaii is seen as a crucial part of America.",1
Probably not,1
Practice makes perfect …,1
"Russia has been punched in the nose and forced to retreat many times by Ukraine. But what you don’t want to do is give Russia a choice of total, humiliating defeat or nukes – then the probability of them using nukes is high.",1
"Obviously many disagree with this logic, but what do they think is their probability of being wrong about WW3. If they say 0%, they are utterly dangerous fools.",1
"But, hey, look on the bright side! At least Russia doesn’t get Crimea in that scenario, so you can be comforted by that thought, while watching the mushroom clouds rise.",1
"If Russia faces destruction of their army and utter defeat by NATO, they will use nukes, then NATO will respond with nukes and civilization is over",1
"Whether one likes it or not, Crimea is absolutely seen as a core part of Russia by Russia. Crimea is also of critical national security importance to Russia, as it is their southern navy base.From their standpoint losing Crimea is like USA losing Hawaii &amp; Pearl Harbor.",1
Exactly,0
"If Russia is faced with the choice of losing Crimea or using battlefield nukes, they will choose the latter.We’ve already sanctioned/cutoff Russia in every possible way, so what more do they have left to lose? If we nuke Russia back, they will nuke us and then we have WW3.",1
Exceptionally well-said,1
"Standard (non-performance) 3 &amp; Y suspension in production now has improved comfort, without affecting handling",1
"Yeah, RV version is lower priority than standard version. You should still see high speeds during off hours. Is that happening?As we add more satellites &amp; upgrade satellite technology, speeds in high user density locations should see significant increases.",0
"Ok, we will add a donate option to Starlink",0
"That’s oddly low. Normally, much higher.",1
Are there others that want to donate Starlinks to places in need?,1
Ok,0
 that’s happened to me many times,1
A much quieter leaf blower is possible,1
"This is harder than it sounds, but ok",0
Deus X Machina,1
"We are proceeding very carefully. If there is a RUD on the pad, Starship progress will be set back by ~6 months.",1
Game over when (not if) Earth gets hit by an object of that size,1
Ramen &gt;&gt; Lambos,1
Used a lot in rocketry,1
So true,0
Every millipede has its millennia,1
We should bring back their outfits,1
Good thread,1
Fancy a game of meme tennis?,0
Buy Burnt Hair from a company that digs holes!,1
I read this as goth clowns lonely,1
Did you hear about the dyslexic KBG agent – it’s pot secret!,1
"Venn diagram intersection of those two audiences is pretty small, I guess",1
Not as popular as I’d hoped (sigh),0
Pitching my idea once again for a crossover of Das Boot &amp; Boss Baby.“Das Baby” – Hijinks on the high seas!,1
"Just a scratch, we can buff it out",1
Mostly accurate,1
The comments in this thread are a conspiracy theorist’s wet dream,0
Yup,1
7 years ago,0
Definitely one of the strangest meetings I’ve ever experienced.  was there too.,1
I’m trying my hardest to de-escalate this situation and obviously failing,0
"Damned if you do, damned if you don’t, so … guess I’m just damned",1
"Starship &amp; next-gen Starlink satellites are key, but much risk lies ahead before those are working at scale",1
The hilarious thing is you’re not wrong ,1
So it goes …,0
Fate loves irony,1
"Even so, we should still do good deeds",0
"The hell with it … even though Starlink is still losing money &amp; other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we’ll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free",0
"That dude is not just a “condition of anonymity” spineless coward, he’s also an ignorant fool. Starlink was directly requested by the Ukraine government, as it was the only thing that worked.",1
"It has required a lot of our resources. Going into super lockdown mode slows down new development progress, as we have to resist attacks from a sophisticated adversary actively at war.",1
"DoD provided about 3% of the Falcon 1 development cost. Appreciated, certainly, but should be seen in context.",1
Of course. And their signal jamming systems are also getting better.,0
"The amount SpaceX is requesting for a major battlefield advantage is less than the cost of one new GPS satellite. Ironically, GPS doesn’t work on battlefields, as the signal is easy to jam, but Starlink does.",0
"Would be great if someday humanity stopped pointing nukes at itself that would destroy almost all life on Earth.In any given year, there is a chance above zero that they will be launched. We are now at the highest risk in 60 years.",1
"Curses, foiled again!",0
Accurate,1
"Russia has the ability to destroy USA &amp; Europe utterly with nuclear missiles in less than 30 minutes &amp; vice versa.A surprising number of people don’t know this.Of course, it would be MAD to use them, but it is also MAD to be in this situation at all.",1
This has potential,1
"Internet fiber, phone lines, cell towers &amp; other space-based comms in war areas have been destroyed. Starlink is all that’s left. For now.",0
Thank you for clarifying this ,0
"Starlink is the primary communications system of the Ukrainian army on the war front. If anyone else wants this job, please be my guest …",1
"Big difference between peace comms vs warfront comms. Starlink is only comms system still working at warfront – others all dead. Russia is actively trying to kill Starlink. To safeguard, SpaceX has diverted massive resources towards defense.Even so, Starlink may still die.",1
Concerning,1
Are there citizens of nations who are helping Ukraine on this list?,0
"But surely no reasonable person would launch nuclear war?The problem with that logic is if we were dealing with reasonable people, we wouldn’t have war in the first place.",0
Is this list real? What’s the URL?,1
Yay!!,1
People should never fear turbulence. Commercial airliner wings can handle insane amounts of bending.,1
The right question to ask,1
We’re just following his recommendation ,1
"Falcon can probably get Starlink past breakeven, but Starship is needed to fund Mars",0
Yes,1
"In addition to terminals, we have to create, launch, maintain &amp; replenish satellites &amp; ground stations &amp; pay telcos for access to Internet via gateways. We’ve also had to defend against cyberattacks &amp; jamming, which are getting harder.Burn is approaching ~$20M/month.",1
"Also, Starlink is still losing money! It is insanely difficult for a LEO communications constellation to avoid bankruptcy – that was the fate of every company that tried this before.When asked what the goal of Starlink was at a space conference, I said “not go bankrupt”.",1
Maybe the  got their ,1
Very few in Iran so far,1
"Strange that nothing was leaked about our competitors in space launch &amp; communications, Lockheed &amp; Boeing, who get over $60B …Wouldn’t be surprised to find this particular individual working there when he retires from DoD. Corruption at its finest.",0
"SpaceX is not asking to recoup past expenses, but also cannot fund the existing system indefinitely *and* send several thousand more terminals that have data usage up to 100X greater than typical households. This is unreasonable.",0
Vital to the future of consciousness,1
srsly,1
Next week,1
Envy has driven him to madness,1
"Starlink requires nothing except ~50 Watt power source. With a small solar system plus battery or a generator, you will have connectivity anywhere.",1
TRUE,1
There are some active terminals,0
"Of course, this happens almost every day. They successfully destroyed Viasat in Ukraine several months ago.",0
"Starlink has faced relentless jamming attacks &amp; SpaceX relentless cyberwar. So far, their success has been limited.",1
Noted,1
Starlink data usage growth in Ukraine,0
"20,000!!",1
Cool,1
Maybe with .3,1
This is real,1
" “My opinion is Burnt Hair is just Elon saying, chill out, have a laugh, and share a laugh.”",0
Oh the irony ,1
"We might need a different name, as this is basically just Starlink with roaming capability, so you can take your terminal anywhere.",0
The counter-intuitive thing is that it’s actually gonna be a sick product!,1
"Please buy my perfume, so I can buy Twitter",1
And right on cue  …,1
You’re most welcome. Glad to support Ukraine.,1
Doesn’t get more lit than this!,0
BE the change you want in the world!,1
Can’t wait for media stories tomorrow about $1M of Burnt Hair sold ,1
"10,000 bottles of Burnt Hair sold!",1
Over 5000 bottles of Burnt Hair sold!,0
An omnigender product,1
"With a name like mine, getting into the fragrance business was inevitable – why did I even fight it for so long!?",0
And you can pay with Doge!,1
The finest fragrance on Earth!,1
Nobody should trust Bremmer,1
Maybe one day we can finally achieve,0
The next question one is typically asked is “Have you tried ayahuasca?”,0
Not subtle,1
"Sam, there is a such a thing as meditating too much",1
"Yes, back to regularly scheduled programming",1
"Pointless, as there is currently no overlap between Russian and Ukrainian demands – it’s not even close",1
"No, it is not. I have spoken to Putin only once and that was about 18 months ago. The subject matter was space.",1
"Talked to ye today &amp; expressed my concerns about his recent tweet, which I think he took to heart",1
It was built &amp; paid for at my request. Hunter &amp; team did great work.,0
It will,0
Strange,0
"I have no desire to become involved in wars, but it is safe to say that all bets are off if the nukes start flying",0
Strong candidate to win most counter-intuitive product of the year!,1
Important to bear in mind when reading anything,1
"Indeed, that kinetic energy scales with the square of velocity is not well-appreciated!A sealed escape pod with a heat shield would probably work.",0
So many blind spots,0
"There are ~25k terminals in Ukraine, but each terminal can be used to provide an Internet uplink to a cell phone tower, so potentially several thousand people can be served by a single terminal",1
Coming soon from The,0
"Yup, it will float",1
Too busy trying to survive at the time,1
They were invited to further their career elsewhere,1
There is a giant 30ft (literal) fork in the road outside the Autopilot office in Palo Alto,0
Mine,1
I love the inverse poetry of making metaphors literal,1
"That is quite an interesting story. We sent what appeared to be identical emails to all, but each was actually coded with either one or two spaces between sentences, forming a binary signature that identified the leaker.",1
Because it runs recursively,1
Nuclear war probability is rising rapidly,0
An eye for an eye leaves everyone blind,1
Perhaps we can talk again today?,1
"True, Starlink provided a decisive battlefield advantage",1
I’ve been up all night trying to think of any possible way to de-escalate this war,0
Feels so long ago. A pleasant memory :),0
Double-header,1
Agreed,1
Beautiful,0
"Welcome back to Twitter, my friend!",1
"Dojo uses bf16, so actual performance difference vs 64 bit is much less than it would seem, since you truncate so many useless zeroes &amp; round from there",0
Two Dragons on,1
Can’t wait to see this beast in action!,1
Even better build coming next week,0
"Quite a few. Trying to do the right thing, which is not always clear.",1
I am in regular contact with Fedorov,1
"Bad reporting by FT. This article falsely claims that Starlink terminals &amp; service were paid for, when only a small percentage have been. This operation has cost SpaceX $80M &amp; will exceed $100M by end of year.As for what’s happening on the battlefield, that’s classified.",1
Starlink will provide the vast majority of bandwidth from space,1
You’d need an electric propeller mounted on the tow hitch to go faster than a few knots. There might a creative wheel hub design that can generate meaningful thrust.,0
Norway rocks!   ,1
In case you missed Tesla AI Day 2022,1
Satellite constellation capability comes down to tonnage to orbit per year times capability per ton,1
SpaceX Dragon docking with  (extended video),0
Very intense 7 days indeed,1
"Personally, I like the latter, but to each their own",0
I think being able to dial the content you see from “warm &amp; fuzzy” all the way to “bring it on mf!” is the way to go,0
"Software engineering, server operations &amp; design will rule the roost",1
There will be very rapid product evolution,1
500 mile range &amp; super fun to drive,1
Excited to announce start of production of Tesla Semi Truck with deliveries to  on Dec 1st!,0
"Tiny helium leak (just barely triggered abort), but we take no risks with customer satellites. Standing down to investigate.",0
Agreed,1
Plot twist!,1
Elon liking his own tweets liking his own tweets …,1
Dragon is now docked to,1
Video,1
Starlink view of 2nd stage deorbit burn,1
I will try my best,1
"I’m a big fan of Ukraine, but not of WW3",0
Cute. You can get surprisingly close to a wild baby rhino &amp; Mom if you stay downwind.,0
There are no angels in war.,0
Accurate assessment,1
Correct,1
"So they’re saying that not buying Twitter is bad, but also buying Twitter is bad!?",1
We talked via videoconference last year,0
War is the ultimate Supreme Court,1
Kherson and Zaporizhzhia almost certainly do not want to join Russia – annexation of those regions was done to ensure a land bridge and water supply to Crimea,1
"Obviously, not everyone who voted for the pro-Russia party wanted to join Russia, but it would also be inaccurate to say that none did.",1
Below is the electoral map of 2012. Blue is the pro-Russia party.,1
"Assuming you believe that the will of the people matters, we should, in any given conflict region, support the will of those who live there. Most of Ukraine unequivocally wants to be part of Ukraine, but some eastern portions have Russian majorities and prefer Russia.",1
"First of all, Tesla hasn’t had that consumer tax credit for years &amp; we didn’t ask for this one – GM &amp; Ford did",0
"Another batch of Starlinks in orbit, 7 hours after the astronaut launch",1
That wouldn’t be hard to do,1
Twitter is an accelerant to fulfilling the original  vision,1
"I do not think it is simple at all, but I have yet to hear any realistic path to peace.Ukraine has achieved many brilliant tactical victories, but should be wary of overconfidence leading to strategic defeat.When Russia fully mobilizes, millions on both sides will die.",0
10.69.3 will actually be a major upgrade. We’re keeping .69 just because haha.,1
"Twitter probably accelerates X by 3 to 5 years, but I could be wrong",1
"Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app",1
"Should be noted that Starlink is still far from cash flow positive. All LEO communications constellations to date have gone bankrupt, so any support is super helpful.",0
"A small number of terminals were paid for by the govt, vast majority were not. This is just another bs WaPo hit piece.",0
"I still very much support Ukraine, but am convinced that massive escalation of the war will cause great harm to Ukraine and possibly the world.",0
"We gave Starlinks to Ukraine &amp; lost $80M+ in doing so, while putting SpaceX &amp; myself at serious risk of Russian cyberattack.What have you done besides tweet?",1
"SpaceX’s out of pocket cost to enable &amp; support Starlink in Ukraine is ~$80M so far. Our support for Russia is $0. Obviously, we are pro Ukraine.Trying to retake Crimea will cause massive death, probably fail &amp; risk nuclear war. This would be terrible for Ukraine &amp; Earth.",1
"In other news, remote controlled anal beads sold out everywhere",1
"That referendum was questionable, which is why I suggested repeating it under UN (or other trusted entity) supervision",1
"Great, offer a UN supervised vote and if Russia refuses, then war it is",1
Maybe a similar approach to Kosovo,0
"No, I’m suggesting voting under UN (or pick your most trusted entity or country) supervision",1
"Russia is doing partial mobilization. They go to full war mobilization if Crimea is at risk. Death on both sides will be devastating.Russia has &gt;3 times population of Ukraine, so victory for Ukraine is unlikely in total war. If you care about the people of Ukraine, seek peace.",1
You are assuming that I wish to be popular. I don’t care.I do care that millions of people may die needlessly for an essentially identical outcome.,1
Let’s try this then: the will of the people who live in the Donbas &amp; Crimea should decide whether they’re part of Russia or Ukraine,1
Cheese is amazing,1
Indeed. Biggest bot attack I’ve ever seen.,0
The bot attack on this poll is strong!,1
"The will of the people should decide whether they are part of Russia or Ukraine, but Russia invaded areas that would unequivocally choose to be part of Ukraine",1
"Also worth noting that a possible, albeit unlikely, outcome from this conflict is nuclear war",1
This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end – just a question of how many die before then,1
"Ukraine-Russia Peace:- Redo elections of annexed regions under UN supervision. Russia leaves if that is will of the people.- Crimea formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783 (until Khrushchev’s mistake).- Water supply to Crimea assured.- Ukraine remains neutral.",1
Yes,1
That is my assessment too,1
"Well-said! Also, we try to operate the team as non-hierarchically as possible &amp; allow movement between project areas, so you don’t get pigeon-holed.",1
I’m trying my hardest! Perhaps more people might consider loving humanity. Our collective light of consciousness is a tiny candle in a vast darkness. Please do not let it go out.,1
Optimus will be sickkk,1

True. Tesla was attacked by Romney in 2 of 3 presidential debates. Those lines were fed to him by a particular individual in the oil &amp; gas industry.The Dems turned negative over the past ~12 months. At least part of it is Mackenzie’s donation to PACs posing as charities.,0

"If we collectively try to figure out the bot/duplicate user percentage, we can probably crowdsource a good answer",1
"Ignore first 1000 followers, then pick every 10th. I’m open to better ideas.",1
Pick any account with a lot of followers,1
"To find out, my team will do a random sample of 100 followers of  I invite others to repeat the same process and see what they discover …",1
"The axiomatic error was that housing prices only go up. I don’t support predatory lending, but many of those lenders were severely wounded or didn’t survive. They dug their own graves – a lesson we should all take to heart, including me.",1

The straw war is emblematic of larger social issues,1
"It still needs more work imo, but we can probably widen the beta a little next month",1
This is messed up,1
Seriously?,1
How did it even start?,1
And tastes like cardboard!,1
The last straw was the last straw!,1
Stop the war on straws!,0
But I do think that twitter should authenticate all real users and prioritize those replies above unauthenticated users,0
The drinking bleach hoax was a hoax,1
Updated Starlink availability by region,1

Current copyright law in general goes absurdly far beyond protecting the original creator,1
The whole notion of being “left wing” or “right wing” is silly. Almost no one initially agrees with the semi-random collection of policies associated with each wing.They only support those policies *after* they join the left or right mind tribe.,1

I’m a big believer in citizen journalism and following individual journalists over publications!,0
"This is false. I’ve had no communication, directly or indirectly, with Trump, who has publicly stated that he will be exclusively on Truth Social.",0
I didn’t ask anyone out or request particular seating,1
"If that’s true, it would make me very happy!",1
"Passive/index investment is simply an amplifier of active investment. If active investment signal degrades in quality, passive is proportionately impacted.Also, if there are very few actual active investors, their decisions can greatly increase company valuation volatility.",1

"Major problem. Passive/index managers should vote in the best interests of shareholders, not shift responsibility to proxy advisory firms.",0

What are talking about? I’m just saying Twitter needs to be politically neutral.,0
"For Twitter to deserve public trust, it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally",1

"Almost every media outlet on Earth wrote about me acquiring Twitter, causing a massive influx of new users",0
"Yeah, I noticed that too. Pretty weird.",1
Should be called Trumpet instead!,1
Truth Social (terrible name) exists because Twitter censored free speech,1
Truth Social is currently beating Twitter &amp; TikTok on the Apple Store,1
Sounds pretty bad …,1
Suspending the Twitter account of a major news organization for publishing a truthful story was obviously incredibly inappropriate,1
Per aspera ad astra!,0
"Raptor 2 rocket engines at Starbase, each producing over half a million pounds (230 tons) of force",0
"By “free speech”, I simply mean that which matches the law. I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law. If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.",0

Eberhard has been relentlessly pushing a false narrative about Tesla for 15 years. He’s a compelling liar. Fooled me for almost 3 years.,0
"They say history is written by the victors, but not on Wikipedia if the losing party is still alive &amp; has lots of time on their hands!",1
"When Eberhard was fired unanimously by the board in July 2007 (for damn good reasons), no one left with him. That says it all.",1
"If filing a shell corp constitutes “founding a company”, then I’d be the only founder of PayPal, since I filed the original incorporation docs for  (later renamed PayPal), but that’s not what founding means.",1
"Not even close to that. It was a shell corp with no employees, no IP, no designs, no prototype, literally nothing but a biz plan to commercialize AC Propulsion’s Tzero car, which was introduced to me by JB Straubel, *not* Eberhard. Even name “Tesla Motors” was owned by others!",0
